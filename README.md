Demo app for "Codux Live: Building an eComm product page ft. RadixUI &amp; TailwindCSS"

In this project we build the UI for an ecommerce product page, using TailwindCSS
for styling and RadixUI for building the more complex UI elements. Throughout,
we'll be using Codux as a platform for visually iterating on the implementation.
